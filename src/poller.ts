/**
 * The poll loop: read new contract events, notify, persist the cursor.
 *
 * ── Failure policy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This process is meant to stay up for weeks. Nothing in one cycle may end it:
 *
 *  - A failed RPC call fails ONE contract's scan for ONE cycle. Its cursor is
 *    left untouched, so the next cycle picks up exactly where it stopped.
 *  - Each contract is paced independently. A slow or failing contract does not
 *    block the scanning of other contracts.
 *  - A scan cursor is committed after its returned page has been processed,
 *    even when delivery was partial. Unknown events, the per-cycle cap, and
 *    exhausted Telegram retries are deliberate drops. Holding the cursor back
 *    would turn a broken token or chat into an infinite replay, and recovery
 *    would flood the channel. Notifications are lossy by design; the chain
 *    remains the record.
 *  - A cursor file that cannot be read or fails schema validation is
 *    quarantined beside the live path (`*.corrupt.<timestamp>`) and treated as
 *    a cold start; one that cannot be written is logged, and the in-memory
 *    cursor keeps working until the next restart.
 *  - Legacy (unversioned / flat) cursor files are migrated in-place to the
 *    current versioned schema on load; unknown future versions are rejected
 *    so a downgrade cannot silently mis-read a newer file.
 *  - A second process that tries to start against the same lock file is refused
 *    up front. Concurrent instances would race the cursor and double-notify.
 *  - A graceful shutdown (`poller.shutdown()`) stops scheduling, drops the
 *    notifications that have not been sent yet, waits a bounded time for the
 *    in-flight cycle, and flushes cursors that are still only in memory. The
 *    process then exits with the file matching what a restart resumes from.
 *  - A cursor that fell below the RPC's retained window ("stale cursor") is
 *    rewound to the retained floor once a fresh `getHealth()` *proves* the
 *    cursor sits below it. Everything below the floor is already gone, so
 *    keeping the cursor would fail every scan forever; rewinding resumes from
 *    the oldest ledger the RPC still serves. The rewind is bounded (at most
 *    `MAX_FLOOR_REWINDS` consecutive attempts, then an operator must act) and
 *    never guesses: an opaque cursor, an ahead-of-tip cursor, or a window that
 *    cannot be read is left untouched and the bounded RPC error is surfaced.
 *    The miss below the floor is logged as a bounded ledger count, never as a
 *    remote payload.
 *
 * ── Event ordering ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Events are notified in deterministic chain order (ledger → transaction
 * index → operation index → RPC paging token), not in RPC array order, so a
 * page split or a retry never reorders the channel. Within one scan,
 * duplicate paging tokens (the RPC may repeat a page-boundary event) notify
 * once. Restarting replays nothing already consumed: the persisted cursor is
 * the only resume token, in the same `version: 1` format as before.
